# Project-Calypso
The hardware and software designs for a turbidity measurement system, based on the work of a 2018 UMN senior design team

## Project Summary

Our team developed an open-source sensor to measure turbidity, meaning cloudiness or murkiness, of water. Turbidity increases when the water carries more sediment, and can also increase when dissolved compounds change the color and clarity of the water. Both suspended and dissolved material relate to water quality; in general, less of both is better for drinking water. This open-source sensor is freely available, meaning that anyone with the ability can download and build one based on the designs (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8177929).

*Two LEDs, red and infrared, send beams across the sample. These interact with the water, which reduces transmission and increases sidewas scatter. The detectors record both changes.*


## Funding Support

Funding for this work came from the ***University of Minnesota Water Resources Center***, with support from the **USGS WRRI** program. This funding supported a grant to Wickert, Sandell, and Karwan, for their proposal entitled, *Open-Source Turbidity Sensor to Monitor Suspended and Dissolved Matter in Surface Water*.
